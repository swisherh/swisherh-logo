<p>
Each number field has a unique label of the form d.r.D.i where
<ul>
<li>\(d\) is the degree;
<li>\(r\) is the real signature;  the full signature is therefore \([r,(d-r)/2]\);
<li>\(D\) is the absolute value of the discriminant;
<li>\(i\) is the index, counting from 1.  This is case there is more than
  field with the same signature and absolute value of the
  discriminant: for example 4.0.1008.1 and 4.0.1008.2.
</ul>
</p>
<p>The database consists of fields from three sources:
<ol>
<li>The PARI database from the Bordeaux PARI group
<li>Additional totally real fields of degrees from 6 to 10 computed by
  John Voight.
<li>Additional fields from John Jones's database (work in progress).
</ol>
See <a href="./Discriminants">Discriminant Ranges</a> for
information the extent of these.
