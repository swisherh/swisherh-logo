        <h1>Labelling Number Fields</h1>

<p>
Each number field has a unique label of the form d.r.D.i where
<ul>
<li>\(d\) is the degree
<li>\(r\) is the real signature (so the full signature is \([r,(d-r)/2]\))
<li>\(D\) is the discriminant
<li>\(i\) is the index, counting from 1 (in case there is more than field
  with the same signature and discriminant: for example 4.0.1008.1 and
  4.0.1008.2)
</ul>
</p>
<p>The database consists of fields from two sources:
<ul>
<li>The PARI database from the Bordeaux PARI group
<li>Additional totally real fields of degrees from 6 to 10 computed by
  John Voight.
</ul>
</p>
