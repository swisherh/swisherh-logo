        <h1>Naming of Galois groups</h1>

<p>
Each Galois group is identified by a label consisting of four integers
(degree, order, sign, index), and also has an official GAP
indentifier.  For convenience, we list here the usual short names for
some of the groups.  These may be used in the search field.
</p>
<p>There are two conventions for the index:  for degrees up to 7,
  there is a separate sequence of indices for each triple
  (degree,order,sign), so most indices are equal to 1.  For degrees 8
  and above, there is a single sequence of indices for each degree.
</p>
<p>
Not all possible groups are listed here, only those which exist for
fields in the database.  In particular there are 2 missing groups in
degree 6, 3 missing in degree 7, and more missing in higher degrees.
</p>
