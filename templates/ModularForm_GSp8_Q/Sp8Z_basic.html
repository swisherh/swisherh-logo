The dimensions for degree 4 Siegel modular cusp forms
 <script type="math/tex">S_k(Sp(8,Z))</script>
for the full group
for weights
 <script type="math/tex">\ k\le16 \ </script>
were proven by <span class="name">C. Poor and D. S. Yuen</span> 
(Computations of spaces of Siegel modular cusp forms, J. Math. Soc. Japan 59 1 (2007), 185-222,
<a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr==2302669">MR2302669</a>).
Poor and Yuen also computed Fourier coefficients and some eigenvalues.
