# I just had a long chat with Robert Bradshaw (a Cython dev), and he

# Cython code into one without -- along with proper dependency
# checking, is now included in the latest development version of
# Cython (Nov 2, 2010).  It's supposed to be a rewrite he did of the
# code in the Sage library.  Hence once that gets released, we should
# switch to using it here.
