{# 
  this is a very simple template based on no other template to render one single Knowl
  for inserting into a website via AJAX or for server-side operations.
#}

{% include "knowl-defs.html" %}
{% from "knowl-defs.html" import KNOWL with context %}

<div class="knowl">
  <h1>{{ k.title|safe }}</h1>
  {# assuming k.content inserts several <div></div> constructs #}
  {{ k.content|safe }}
</div>
